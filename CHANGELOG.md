# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-13

- Fix Railway startup by restoring the original checksum for migration `002_create_orders.sql`.

- Process every inbound WhatsApp message in batched webhook payloads instead of dropping all but the first.
- Resume timed-out wholesale scheduling through the correct advisor state.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-13

- Baseline release of the Rust WhatsApp ordering bot before the post-release workflow bugfixes.
